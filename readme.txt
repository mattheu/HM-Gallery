Gallery and Gallery management for your WordPress site. 

== Description ==

Gallery management for your WordPress site. HM Gallery allows you to manage a gallery of images from the Add New/Edit Entry Page of the Wordpress admin.

This plugin is aimed at theme developers as it requires some knowledge of editing template files. No CSS styles are applied, allowing full customisation by the developer. 

This plugin is a fork of the HM Portfolio Plugin. It may work, but compatability is not guaranteed.
